Route to the appropriate codebase-intelligence skill based on the user's intent.
`gsd-scan` and `gsd-intel` were folded into `gsd-map-codebase` flags by #2790.

| User wants | Invoke |
|---|---|
| Map the full codebase structure | gsd-map-codebase |
| Quick lightweight codebase scan | gsd-map-codebase --fast |
| Query mapped intelligence files | gsd-map-codebase --query |
| Generate a knowledge graph | gsd-graphify |
| Update project documentation | gsd-docs-update |
| Extract learnings from a completed phase | gsd-extract-learnings |
| Recall prior decisions and patterns before planning | gsd-mempalace-recall |
| File a phase artifact into MemPalace | gsd-mempalace-capture |

Invoke the matched skill directly using the Skill tool.

## Local adoption — read before using this source

The complete upstream body above is retained from GSD-Core at
`c0b2a05d2f310adc0a1f35fd71fbc9f28f4e4977`; only recorded reference substitutions
and explicit local conflict corrections have been made. See
`.ai/gsd/PROVENANCE.json` for exact source hashes and changes.

Read `.ai/gsd/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/gsd-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The upstream `config.json`, `/gsd:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe GSD's system; this import does not
install or activate that system. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
