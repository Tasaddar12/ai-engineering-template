<objective>
Check project progress, summarize recent work and what's ahead, then intelligently route to the next action.

Three modes:
- **default**: Show progress report + intelligently route to the next action (execute or plan). Provides situational awareness before continuing work.
- **--next**: Automatically advance to the next logical step without manual route selection. Reads STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, and phase directories. Supports `--force` to bypass safety gates.
- **--do "task description"**: Analyze freeform natural language and dispatch to the most appropriate GSD command. Never does the work itself — matches intent, confirms, hands off.
- **--forensic**: Append a 6-check integrity audit after the standard progress report.
</objective>

<flags>
- **--next**: Detect current project state and automatically invoke the next logical GSD workflow step. Scans all prior phases for incomplete work before routing. `--next --force` bypasses safety gates.
- **--next --auto**: Like `--next`, but after the determined step completes, automatically re-invokes `/gsd:progress --next --auto` to continue chaining steps until completion or a blocking decision. Enables hands-free plan→execute→verify→complete progression.
- **--next --converge**: When the next action is planning (Route 3), route it through the plan-review **convergence** loop instead of the standard planner. Requires `workflow.plan_review_convergence=true` (enable with `gsd config-set workflow.plan_review_convergence true`). `--cross-ai` is an alias. Reviewer flags (`--codex`, `--gemini`, `--claude`, `--opencode`, `--ollama`, `--lm-studio`, `--llama-cpp`, `--all`) and `--max-cycles N` are forwarded to the convergence loop.
- **--do "..."**: Smart dispatcher — match freeform intent to the best GSD command using routing rules, confirm the match, then hand off.
- **--forensic**: Run 6-check integrity audit after the standard progress report.
- **(no flag)**: Standard progress check + intelligent routing (Routes A through F).

Arguments provided: "$ARGUMENTS"
Parse the first token from the provided arguments:
- If it is `--next`: strip the flag, execute the next workflow (passing remaining args e.g. --force, --auto).
- If it is `--do`: strip the flag, pass remainder as freeform intent to the do workflow.
- Otherwise: execute the progress workflow end-to-end (pass --forensic through if present).

Preserve all routing logic from the target workflow.

## Local adoption — read before using this source

The complete upstream body above is retained from GSD-Core at
`c0b2a05d2f310adc0a1f35fd71fbc9f28f4e4977`; only recorded reference substitutions
and explicit local conflict corrections have been made. See
`.ai/gsd/PROVENANCE.json` for exact source hashes and changes.

Read `.ai/gsd/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/gsd-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The upstream `config.json`, `/gsd:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe GSD's system; this import does not
install or activate that system. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
