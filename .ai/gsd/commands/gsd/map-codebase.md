<objective>
Analyze existing codebase using parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents to produce structured codebase documents.

Each mapper agent explores a focus area and **writes documents directly** to `.planning/codebase/`. The orchestrator only receives confirmations, keeping context usage minimal.

Output: .planning/codebase/ folder with 7 structured documents about the codebase state.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.ai/gsd/workflows/map-codebase.md
</execution_context>

<flags>
- **--fast**: Lightweight scan mode — spawns one mapper agent instead of four. Accepts an optional `--focus` value: `tech`, `arch`, `quality`, `concerns`, or `tech+arch` (default). Faster and lower-context than the full map.
- **--query**: Codebase intelligence query mode. Sub-commands: `query <term>`, `status`, `diff`, `refresh`. Requires intel to be enabled in config (`intel.enabled: true`). Runs inline for query/status/diff; spawns an agent for refresh.
- **(no flag)**: Full parallel map — spawns 4 mapper agents to produce all 7 codebase documents.
</flags>

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the first token of $ARGUMENTS:
- If it is `--fast`: strip the flag, then read and execute `.ai/gsd/workflows/scan.md` (passing remaining args including optional --focus). Load it on demand here — it is deliberately not in `<execution_context>`, so the common full-map path does not pay for it.
- If it is `--query`: strip the flag, run the intel workflow (passing remaining args as the subcommand).
- Otherwise: pass all of $ARGUMENTS as focus area to the map-codebase workflow.

**Load project state if exists:**
Check for .planning/STATE.md - loads context if project already initialized

**This command can run:**
- Via /gsd:onboard for first-time brownfield setup - creates codebase map first
- After /gsd:new-project (greenfield codebases) - updates codebase map as code evolves
- Anytime to refresh codebase understanding
</context>

<when_to_use>
**Use map-codebase for:**
- Brownfield projects before initialization (understand existing code first)
- Refreshing codebase map after significant changes
- Refreshing or deepening an onboarded codebase map
- Before major refactoring (understand current state)
- When STATE.md references outdated codebase info

**Skip map-codebase for:**
- Greenfield projects with no code yet (nothing to map)
- Trivial codebases (<5 files)
</when_to_use>

<process>
1. Check if .planning/codebase/ already exists (offer to refresh or skip)
2. Create .planning/codebase/ directory structure
3. Spawn 4 parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents:
   - Agent 1: tech focus → writes STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md
   - Agent 2: arch focus → writes ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md
   - Agent 3: quality focus → writes CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md
   - Agent 4: concerns focus → writes CONCERNS.md
4. Wait for agents to complete, collect confirmations (NOT document contents)
5. Verify all 7 documents exist with line counts
6. Commit codebase map
7. Offer next steps (typically: /gsd:onboard, /gsd:new-project, or /gsd:plan-phase)
</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] .planning/codebase/ directory created
- [ ] All 7 codebase documents written by mapper agents
- [ ] Documents follow template structure
- [ ] Parallel agents completed without errors
- [ ] User knows next steps
</success_criteria>

## Local adoption — read before using this source

The complete upstream body above is retained from GSD-Core at
`c0b2a05d2f310adc0a1f35fd71fbc9f28f4e4977`; only recorded reference substitutions
and explicit local conflict corrections have been made. See
`.ai/gsd/PROVENANCE.json` for exact source hashes and changes.

Read `.ai/gsd/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/gsd-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The upstream `config.json`, `/gsd:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe GSD's system; this import does not
install or activate that system. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
