<objective>
Display GSD help at the tier the user asked for: brief (one-line refresher), default (one-page tour), full (complete reference), a single topic section, or a compact scoped lookup of one topic (`--brief <topic>`: signature + one-line summary).

Output ONLY the reference content of the chosen tier. Do NOT add:
- Project-specific analysis
- Git status or file context
- Next-step suggestions
- Any commentary beyond the reference
</objective>

## Local adoption — read before using this source

The complete upstream body above is retained from GSD-Core at
`c0b2a05d2f310adc0a1f35fd71fbc9f28f4e4977`; only recorded reference substitutions
and explicit local conflict corrections have been made. See
`.ai/gsd/PROVENANCE.json` for exact source hashes and changes.

Read `.ai/gsd/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/gsd-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The upstream `config.json`, `/gsd:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe GSD's system; this import does not
install or activate that system. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
