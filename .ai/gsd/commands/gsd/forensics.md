<objective>
Investigate what went wrong during a GSD workflow execution. Analyzes git history, `.planning/` artifacts, and file system state to detect anomalies and generate a structured diagnostic report.

Purpose: Diagnose failed or stuck workflows so the user can understand root cause and take corrective action.
Output: Forensic report saved to `.planning/forensics/`, presented inline, with optional issue creation.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.ai/gsd/workflows/forensics.md
</execution_context>

<context>
**Data sources:**
- `git log` (recent commits, patterns, time gaps)
- `git status` / `git diff` (uncommitted work, conflicts)
- `.planning/STATE.md` (current position, session history)
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` (phase scope and progress)
- `.planning/phases/*/` (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, VERIFICATION.md, CONTEXT.md)
- `.planning/reports/SESSION_REPORT.md` (last session outcomes)

**User input:**
- Problem description: $ARGUMENTS (optional — will ask if not provided)
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Evidence gathered from all available data sources
- At least 4 anomaly types checked (stuck loop, missing artifacts, abandoned work, crash/interruption)
- Structured forensic report written to `.planning/forensics/report-{timestamp}.md`
- Report presented inline with findings, anomalies, and recommendations
- Interactive investigation offered for deeper analysis
- GitHub issue creation offered if actionable findings exist
</success_criteria>

<critical_rules>
- **Read-only investigation:** Do not modify project source files during forensics. Only write the forensic report and update STATE.md session tracking.
- **Redact sensitive data:** Strip absolute paths, API keys, tokens from reports and issues.
- **Ground findings in evidence:** Every anomaly must cite specific commits, files, or state data.
- **No speculation without evidence:** If data is insufficient, say so — do not fabricate root causes.
</critical_rules>

## Local adoption — read before using this source

The complete upstream body above is retained from GSD-Core at
`c0b2a05d2f310adc0a1f35fd71fbc9f28f4e4977`; only recorded reference substitutions
and explicit local conflict corrections have been made. See
`.ai/gsd/PROVENANCE.json` for exact source hashes and changes.

Read `.ai/gsd/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/gsd-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The upstream `config.json`, `/gsd:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe GSD's system; this import does not
install or activate that system. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
