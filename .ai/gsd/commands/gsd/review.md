description: Request cross-AI peer review of phase plans from external AI CLIs
argument-hint: "--phase N [--gemini] [--claude] [--codex] [--opencode] [--qwen] [--cursor] [--agy] [--all]"

<objective>
Invoke external AI CLIs (Gemini, Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Cursor) to independently review phase plans.
Produces a structured REVIEWS.md with per-reviewer feedback that can be fed back into
planning via /gsd:plan-phase --reviews.

**Flow:** Detect CLIs → Build review prompt → Invoke each CLI → Collect responses → Write REVIEWS.md
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.ai/gsd/workflows/review.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase number: extracted from $ARGUMENTS (required)

**Flags:**
- `--gemini` — Include Gemini CLI review
- `--claude` — Include Claude CLI review (uses separate session)
- `--codex` — Include Codex CLI review
- `--opencode` — Include OpenCode review (uses model from user's OpenCode config)
- `--qwen` — Include Qwen Code review (Alibaba Qwen models)
- `--cursor` — Include Cursor agent review
- `--agy` / `--antigravity` — Include Antigravity CLI review
- `--all` — Include all available CLIs

**No flags** — if `review.default_reviewers` is set, review with only those configured
reviewers that are detected; otherwise review with all available CLIs. Configured
`review.reviewer_instances` names may appear in `review.default_reviewers`; each runs as an
independent reviewer identity backed by its configured adapter+model (see
`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`). Instance names are not valid as flags.

## Local adoption — read before using this source

The complete upstream body above is retained from GSD-Core at
`c0b2a05d2f310adc0a1f35fd71fbc9f28f4e4977`; only recorded reference substitutions
and explicit local conflict corrections have been made. See
`.ai/gsd/PROVENANCE.json` for exact source hashes and changes.

Read `.ai/gsd/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/gsd-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The upstream `config.json`, `/gsd:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe GSD's system; this import does not
install or activate that system. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
