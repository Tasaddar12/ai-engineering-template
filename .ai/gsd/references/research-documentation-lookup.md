When you need library or framework documentation, check in this order:

1. If Context7 MCP tools (`mcp__context7__*`) are available in your environment, use them:
   - Resolve library ID: `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` with `libraryName`
   - Fetch docs: `mcp__context7__query-docs` with `libraryId` (the ID from step 1) and `query`

2. If Context7 MCP is not available (custom subagents cannot see project-scoped
   `.mcp.json` servers — they only inherit user-scoped `~/.claude/mcp.json`, so a
   context7 server configured at the project scope is invisible to spawned
   agents), use the CLI fallback via Bash:

   Step 1 — Resolve library ID:
   ```bash
   if command -v ctx7 &>/dev/null; then
     ctx7 library <name> "<query>"
   else
     echo "ctx7 not found — install with: npm install -g ctx7 (verify at npmjs.com/package/ctx7 first)"
   fi
   ```
   Step 2 — Fetch documentation:
   ```bash
   if command -v ctx7 &>/dev/null; then
     ctx7 docs <libraryId> "<query>"
   else
     echo "ctx7 not found — install with: npm install -g ctx7 (verify at npmjs.com/package/ctx7 first)"
   fi
   ```

Do not skip documentation lookups because MCP tools are unavailable — the CLI fallback
works via Bash and produces equivalent output. Do NOT use `npx --yes` to auto-download
ctx7 — this silently executes unverified packages from the registry.

## Local adoption — read before using this source

The complete upstream body above is retained from GSD-Core at
`c0b2a05d2f310adc0a1f35fd71fbc9f28f4e4977`; only recorded reference substitutions
and explicit local conflict corrections have been made. See
`.ai/gsd/PROVENANCE.json` for exact source hashes and changes.

Read `.ai/gsd/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/gsd-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The upstream `config.json`, `/gsd:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe GSD's system; this import does not
install or activate that system. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
