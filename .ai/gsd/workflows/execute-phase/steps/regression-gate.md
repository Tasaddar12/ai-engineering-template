<step name="regression_gate">
Run prior phases' test suites to catch cross-phase regressions BEFORE verification.

**Skip if:** This is the first phase (no prior phases), or no prior VERIFICATION.md files exist.

**Step 1: Discover prior phases' test files**
```bash
# Find all VERIFICATION.md files from prior phases in current milestone
PRIOR_VERIFICATIONS=$(find .planning/phases/ -name "*-VERIFICATION.md" ! -path "*${PHASE_NUMBER}*" 2>/dev/null)
```

**Step 2: Extract test file lists from prior verifications**

For each VERIFICATION.md found, look for test file references:
- Lines containing `test`, `spec`, or `__tests__` paths
- The "Test Suite" or "Automated Checks" section
- File patterns from `key-files.created` in corresponding SUMMARY.md files that match `*.test.*` or `*.spec.*`

Collect all unique test file paths into `REGRESSION_FILES`.

**Step 3: Run regression tests (if any found)** — Read and execute `.ai/gsd/workflows/execute-phase/steps/regression-gate-run.md`. It resolves the project test command, normalizes it to a one-shot form (defeating vitest/jest watch mode via the shared `normalize-test-command` helper), runs it under `workflow.test_gate_timeout`, and aborts on timeout with a watch-mode hint (#1857). On `REGRESSION GATE ABORTED` (exit 124), HALT — do not proceed to verification.

**Step 4: Report results**

If all tests pass:
```
✓ Regression gate: {N} prior-phase test files passed — no regressions detected
```
→ Proceed to verify_phase_goal

If any tests fail:
```
## ⚠ Cross-Phase Regression Detected

Phase {X} execution may have broken functionality from prior phases.

| Test File | Phase | Status | Detail |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| {file} | {origin_phase} | FAILED | {first_failure_line} |

Options:
1. Fix regressions before verification (recommended)
2. Continue to verification anyway (regressions will compound)
3. Abort phase — roll back and re-plan
```

If `TEXT_MODE` is true, present as a plain-text numbered list and ask the user to type their choice number. Otherwise, use AskUserQuestion to present the options.

## Local adoption — read before using this source

The complete upstream body above is retained from GSD-Core at
`c0b2a05d2f310adc0a1f35fd71fbc9f28f4e4977`; only recorded reference substitutions
and explicit local conflict corrections have been made. See
`.ai/gsd/PROVENANCE.json` for exact source hashes and changes.

Read `.ai/gsd/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/gsd-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The upstream `config.json`, `/gsd:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe GSD's system; this import does not
install or activate that system. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
