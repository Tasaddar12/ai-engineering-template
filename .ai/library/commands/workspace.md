<objective>
Manage Workflow workspaces with a single consolidated command.

Mode routing:
- **--new**: Create an isolated workspace with repo copies and independent .planning/ → new-workspace workflow
- **--list**: List active Workflow workspaces and their status → list-workspaces workflow
- **--remove**: Remove a Workflow workspace and clean up worktrees → remove-workspace workflow
</objective>

<routing>

| Flag | Action | Workflow |
|------|--------|----------|
| --new | Create workspace with worktree/clone strategy | new-workspace |
| --list | Scan ~/workflow-workspaces/, show summary table | list-workspaces |
| --remove | Confirm and remove workspace directory | remove-workspace |

</routing>

<execution_context>
@.ai/library/workflows/new-workspace.md
@.ai/library/workflows/list-workspaces.md
@.ai/library/workflows/remove-workspace.md
@.ai/library/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the first token of $ARGUMENTS:
- If it is `--new`: strip the flag, pass remainder (--name, --repos, --path, --strategy, --branch, --auto flags) to new-workspace workflow
- If it is `--list`: execute list-workspaces workflow (no argument needed)
- If it is `--remove`: strip the flag, pass remainder (workspace-name) to remove-workspace workflow
- Otherwise (no flag): show usage — one of --new, --list, or --remove is required
</context>

<process>
1. Parse the leading flag from $ARGUMENTS.
2. Load and execute the appropriate workflow end-to-end based on the routing table above.
3. Preserve all workflow gates from the target workflow (validation, approvals, commits, routing).
</process>

## Local adoption — read before using this source

This complete authoring guide retains its source content, examples, and methods.
Only recorded namespace/reference substitutions and explicit local conflict
corrections have been made. Source attribution and exact original hashes are
isolated in `.ai/library/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and `PROVENANCE.json`.

Read `.ai/library/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/template-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The retained `config.json`, `/workflow:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe supporting source capabilities;
this import does not install or activate them. Source catalog pointers in examples
identify provenance, not executable command arguments. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
