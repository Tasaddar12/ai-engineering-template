<objective>
One-command triage of the project's GitHub inbox. Fetches all open issues and PRs,
reviews each against the corresponding template requirements (feature, enhancement,
bug, chore, fix PR, enhancement PR, feature PR), reports completeness and compliance,
and optionally applies labels or closes non-compliant submissions.

**Flow:** Detect repo → Fetch open issues + PRs → Classify each by type → Review against template → Report findings → Optionally act (label, comment, close)
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.ai/library/workflows/inbox.md
</execution_context>

<context>
**Flags:**
- `--issues` — Review only issues (skip PRs)
- `--prs` — Review only PRs (skip issues)
- `--label` — Auto-apply recommended labels after review
- `--close-incomplete` — Close issues/PRs that fail template compliance (with comment explaining why)
- `--repo owner/repo` — Override auto-detected repository (defaults to current git remote)
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
Parse flags from arguments and pass to workflow.

## Local adoption — read before using this source

This complete authoring guide retains its source content, examples, and methods.
Only recorded namespace/reference substitutions and explicit local conflict
corrections have been made. Source attribution and exact original hashes are
isolated in `.ai/library/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and `PROVENANCE.json`.

Read `.ai/library/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/template-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The retained `config.json`, `/workflow:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe supporting source capabilities;
this import does not install or activate them. Source catalog pointers in examples
identify provenance, not executable command arguments. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
