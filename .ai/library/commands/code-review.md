<objective>
Review source files changed during a phase for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code quality problems.

Spawns the code-reviewer agent to analyze code at the specified depth level. Produces REVIEW.md artifact in the phase directory with severity-classified findings.

Arguments:
- Phase number (required) — which phase's changes to review (e.g., "2" or "02")
- `--depth=quick|standard|deep` (optional) — review depth level, overrides workflow.code_review_depth config
  - quick: Pattern-matching only (~2 min)
  - standard: Per-file analysis with language-specific checks (~5-15 min, default)
  - deep: Cross-file analysis including import graphs and call chains (~15-30 min)
- `--files file1,file2,...` (optional) — explicit comma-separated file list, skips SUMMARY/git scoping (highest precedence for scoping)
- `--fix` (optional) — after review completes (or if REVIEW.md already exists), auto-apply fixes found. Spawns code-fixer agent. Accepts sub-flags:
  - `--all` — include Info findings in fix scope (default: Critical + Warning only)
  - `--auto` — enable fix + re-review iteration loop, capped at 3 iterations
- Optional reviewer-lane flags (#4209) — any flag returned by `workflow_run review-lane flags` (the canonical reviewer-lane roster; e.g. `--codex`, `--agy`) requests that lane independently review the same already-resolved scope alongside the internal `code-reviewer` agent. Its findings are corroborating evidence only — `code-reviewer` alone verifies each claim against the actual source and writes REVIEW.md; there is exactly one REVIEW.md schema. No reviewer-lane flag (the default) reviews with only the internal agent, byte-for-byte unchanged from before #4209.

Output: {padded_phase}-REVIEW.md in phase directory + inline summary of findings

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS (first positional argument is phase number)

Optional flags parsed from $ARGUMENTS:
- `--depth=VALUE` — Depth override (quick|standard|deep). If provided, overrides workflow.code_review_depth config.
- `--files=file1,file2,...` — Explicit file list override. Has highest precedence for file scoping per D-08. When provided, workflow skips SUMMARY.md extraction and git diff fallback entirely.

Context files (CLAUDE.md, SUMMARY.md, phase state) are resolved inside the workflow via `workflow-tools query init.phase-op` and delegated to agent via `<required_reading>` blocks.
</context>

<process>
This command is a thin dispatch layer. It parses arguments and delegates to the workflow.

Execute end-to-end.

The workflow (not this command) enforces these gates:
- Phase validation (before config gate)
- Config gate check (workflow.code_review)
- File scoping (--files override > SUMMARY.md > git diff fallback)
- Empty scope check (skip if no files)
- Agent spawning (code-reviewer)
- Result presentation (inline summary + next steps)
</process>

## Local adoption — read before using this source

This complete authoring guide retains its source content, examples, and methods.
Only recorded namespace/reference substitutions and explicit local conflict
corrections have been made. Source attribution and exact original hashes are
isolated in `.ai/library/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and `PROVENANCE.json`.

Read `.ai/library/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/template-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The retained `config.json`, `/workflow:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe supporting source capabilities;
this import does not install or activate them. Source catalog pointers in examples
identify provenance, not executable command arguments. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
