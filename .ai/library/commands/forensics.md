<objective>
Investigate what went wrong during a Workflow workflow execution. Analyzes git history, `.planning/` artifacts, and file system state to detect anomalies and generate a structured diagnostic report.

Purpose: Diagnose failed or stuck workflows so the user can understand root cause and take corrective action.
Output: Forensic report saved to `.planning/forensics/`, presented inline, with optional issue creation.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.ai/library/workflows/forensics.md
</execution_context>

<context>
**Data sources:**
- `git log` (recent commits, patterns, time gaps)
- `git status` / `git diff` (uncommitted work, conflicts)
- `.planning/STATE.md` (current position, session history)
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` (phase scope and progress)
- `.planning/phases/*/` (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, VERIFICATION.md, CONTEXT.md)
- `.planning/reports/SESSION_REPORT.md` (last session outcomes)

**User input:**
- Problem description: $ARGUMENTS (optional — will ask if not provided)
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Evidence gathered from all available data sources
- At least 4 anomaly types checked (stuck loop, missing artifacts, abandoned work, crash/interruption)
- Structured forensic report written to `.planning/forensics/report-{timestamp}.md`
- Report presented inline with findings, anomalies, and recommendations
- Interactive investigation offered for deeper analysis
- GitHub issue creation offered if actionable findings exist
</success_criteria>

<critical_rules>
- **Read-only investigation:** Do not modify project source files during forensics. Only write the forensic report and update STATE.md session tracking.
- **Redact sensitive data:** Strip absolute paths, API keys, tokens from reports and issues.
- **Ground findings in evidence:** Every anomaly must cite specific commits, files, or state data.
- **No speculation without evidence:** If data is insufficient, say so — do not fabricate root causes.
</critical_rules>

## Local adoption — read before using this source

This complete authoring guide retains its source content, examples, and methods.
Only recorded namespace/reference substitutions and explicit local conflict
corrections have been made. Source attribution and exact original hashes are
isolated in `.ai/library/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and `PROVENANCE.json`.

Read `.ai/library/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/template-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The retained `config.json`, `/workflow:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe supporting source capabilities;
this import does not install or activate them. Source catalog pointers in examples
identify provenance, not executable command arguments. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
