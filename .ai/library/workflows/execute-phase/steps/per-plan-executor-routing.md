# Per-plan executor routing (#1689)

Run for each plan, immediately before its `Agent()` dispatch in step 3. Sets
`EXECUTOR_TYPE` so a plan can opt into a specialist executor instead of the
default `executor`. `plan_json` (the current plan's object from
`phase-plan-index`, same scope step 2.5 uses) is in scope.

## Contract

- Default: `EXECUTOR_TYPE="executor"` — byte-identical to pre-#1689 dispatch.
- A plan opts into a specialist by declaring `agent_hint: <name>` in its PLAN.md
  frontmatter. The field reaches the orchestrator as `plan_json.agent_hint`
  (parsed by `phase-plan-index`; `null` when unset).
- When routing is enabled AND the hint is non-empty AND the named agent resolves
  on the active runtime, `EXECUTOR_TYPE` becomes the hint. Otherwise it stays
  `executor`.
- The resolved `EXECUTOR_TYPE` is used as `subagent_type` in BOTH worktree and
  sequential dispatch (sequential reuses the worktree-mode `Agent()` template).

if [ "${ISOLATION:-}" = "orchestrator-worktree" ] && [ -n "${PLAN_HINT:-}" ]; then

fi
```

`workflow_run query resolve-agent` consults the **active runtime's agent directory**
(both project-local and user-global, across runtime filename variants — `.md`,
`.agent.md`, `.toml`, the kimi `subagents/<name>.{yaml,md}` pair) and fails
closed to `executor` when the named agent does not resolve or on any error,
so a missing or misspelled hint never blocks dispatch.

## Scope

Routing applies to the `Agent()`-based dispatch (harness-worktree and sequential
modes). The `orchestrator-worktree` isolation backend spawns executors via a
separate process path that has no `subagent_type` and is not routed in this
release.

## Checkpoint gate rule (#3370)

Loaded with the routing resolution so the orchestrator reads it immediately
before composing each dispatch prompt, in every isolation mode.

On `checkpoint:human-verify` / `checkpoint:decision` tasks, `gate="blocking"`
(the default) is auto-approvable in auto-mode — that is the executor's own
`<checkpoint_protocol>` (`.ai/library/agents/executor.md`), and `checkpoints.md` (the
full gate table) is embedded in the dispatch `<execution_context>` verbatim.
Only `gate="blocking-human"` always surfaces to a human, regardless of
auto-mode. An unmet `<precondition>` checkpoint (executor step 0, `Blocked by:
Precondition not met` — unmet `user_setup` step, missing env var, absent
prior-phase artifact) reports `blocking-human` and therefore always surfaces
to a human, in every mode (#3210): the missing prerequisite is a fact only a
human can establish, not a verification step to rubber-stamp.

When composing the `Agent()` prompt, do NOT add text refusing or overriding
auto-approval for a `blocking` gate. Orchestrator-composed instructions that contradict the
executor's protocol win the executor's attention, stall autonomous runs at the
checkpoint, and defeat `_auto_chain_active`/auto-advance for the common case.
Executor-side gate semantics are already complete; compose nothing about gates
beyond what the template already embeds.

and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact

The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The retained `config.json`, `/workflow:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe supporting source capabilities;
this import does not install or activate them. Source catalog pointers in examples
identify provenance, not executable command arguments. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
