**Step 8: Verification (only when `$VALIDATE_MODE`)**

Skip this step entirely if NOT `$VALIDATE_MODE`.

For every item merged in Step 7 (status still `pending`, a real `commit` was
recorded by the merge) that has not yet been verified:

Read status via the SAME canonical, total query `/workflow:quick` uses (never
re-derive the status vocabulary inline):
```bash

**Route via `quick-batch verification-routing`** (wraps
`routeVerificationOutcome`, `src/quick-batch-dispatch.cts` — the single
source of truth for this routing, never re-derived inline):
```bash
QB_VERIFY_ROUTE_JSON=$(workflow_run quick-batch verification-routing --status "$STATUS" --raw)
```

| `action` | Meaning | What this step does |
|---|---|---|
| `complete` | `STATUS == "passed"` | Proceed to Step 9 for this item — `quick-batch complete` is called there. |
| `human_needed` | Verifier flagged manual review | **Terminal for this item.** Do NOT call `quick-batch complete` — no STATE row is appended (row 30). Display the items needing manual check; continue with the rest of the batch. |
| `fail` | `STATUS == "gaps_found"` (or `missing`/`unknown`/`stale` — anything the query could not resolve to a real answer) | Mark the item `failed` with the routing's `failureReason`. NO automatic gap-fix retry (v1 exclusion), NO rollback of the already-merged commit (row 31/34). Continue with the rest of the batch. |

An item this step marks `human_needed` or `failed` is NOT reverted — its
worktree was already removed by the successful merge in Step 7 (verification
runs post-merge, unlike a `merge_failed`/`scope_violation` routing, which
never reaches this step because the item never merged).

Continue to Step 9 once every merged item has been verified (or explicitly
routed to `human_needed`/`failed`).

## Local adoption — read before using this source

This complete authoring guide retains its source content, examples, and methods.
Only recorded namespace/reference substitutions and explicit local conflict
corrections have been made. Source attribution and exact original hashes are
isolated in `.ai/library/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and `PROVENANCE.json`.

Read `.ai/library/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/template-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The retained `config.json`, `/workflow:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe supporting source capabilities;
this import does not install or activate them. Source catalog pointers in examples
identify provenance, not executable command arguments. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
