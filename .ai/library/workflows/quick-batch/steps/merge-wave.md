**Step 7: Deterministic merge**

Skip entirely if `$ISOLATION == "none"` — nothing was worktree-isolated,
there is nothing to merge (executors already committed to the primary
checkout in Step 6).

**Merge rounds.** Repeat until no wave has a mergeable prefix left (bounded
by `$ITEM_COUNT` rounds):

1. For each DISTINCT `wave` value present among items that are
   `status == "pending"` with a `${item_dir}/${quick_id}-SUMMARY.md` on disk
   (executor returned) and NOT yet merged: build `$WAVE_ORDER_JSON` — the
   `quick_id`s of every item AT THAT WAVE, in `$BATCH_MANIFEST_JSON.items`
   array order (this IS the order `computeWaves`/`partitionByFileOverlap`
   assigned — never re-sort it).

2. Build `$READY_JSON` — the subset of that wave's items whose
   `SUMMARY.md` already exists (an executor may still be mid-flight for a
   sibling in the same wave; row 33 — merges happen strictly in wave order,
   an out-of-order finisher waits):
   ```bash
_Workflow_SHIM_NAME="workflow-tools.cjs"; _Workflow_RUNTIME_ROOT="${RUNTIME_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}"; Workflow_TOOLS="${_Workflow_RUNTIME_ROOT}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}"; _workflow_at() { for _p; do if [ -f "$_p" ]; then Workflow_TOOLS="$_p"; return 0; fi; done; return 1; }; if _workflow_at "${_Workflow_RUNTIME_ROOT}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${_Workflow_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.claude/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${_Workflow_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.codex/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}"; then workflow_run() { node "$Workflow_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif unset -f workflow_run; _G="$(command -v workflow_run)"; then Workflow_TOOLS="$_G"; workflow_run() { "$Workflow_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif _workflow_at "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cursor}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${COPILOT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.copilot}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${WINDSURF_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codeium/windsurf}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${AUGMENT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.augment}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${TRAE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.trae}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${QWEN_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.qwen}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEBUDDY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codebuddy}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${CLINE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cline}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${GROK_AGENTS_HOME:-$HOME/.agents}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${ANTIGRAVITY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini/antigravity}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/opencode}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${KILO_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/kilo}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}"; then workflow_run() { node "$Workflow_TOOLS" "$@"; }; else echo "ERROR: workflow-tools.cjs not found at $Workflow_TOOLS and workflow_run is not on PATH. Run: npx -y @openworkflow/workflow-core@latest --claude --local" >&2; exit 1; fi; Workflow_IDENTITY_STATUS=unverified; case "$(workflow_run runtime-identity --raw 2>/dev/null || true)" in '{"packageName":"@openworkflow/workflow-core"'*'}') Workflow_IDENTITY_STATUS=ok;; esac; export Workflow_IDENTITY_STATUS; [ "$Workflow_IDENTITY_STATUS" = ok ] || echo "WARNING: \"$Workflow_TOOLS\" did not prove it is @openworkflow/workflow-core - it is either a different package or an @openworkflow/workflow-core older than the runtime-identity verb. See docs/how-to/diagnose-a-foreign-workflow-tools.md" >&2; if [ -n "${CLAUDE_ENV_FILE:-}" ] && [ -n "${Workflow_TOOLS:-}" ]; then printf "export PATH='%s':\"\$PATH\"\n" "${Workflow_TOOLS%/*}" >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" 2>/dev/null || true; fi
   QB_MERGE_ELIG_JSON=$(workflow_run quick-batch merge-eligible --wave-order "$WAVE_ORDER_JSON" --ready "$READY_JSON" --raw)
   ```
   Parse `mergeable` — the PREFIX of `$WAVE_ORDER_JSON` currently mergeable.
   If empty, skip this wave this round (its first item hasn't finished yet).

3. **Build the cleanup-wave manifest for `mergeable`, IN THAT ORDER** — fresh
   from each item's own PLAN.md, never from `BATCH.json`'s `planned_files`
   alone (Open Question 2's accepted resolution). `$mergeable` is a bash
   ARRAY (parsed from the JSON `mergeable` array) — never a plain
   space-joined string, which re-splits unpredictably between bash and zsh
   (#4109):
   ```bash
   for quick_id in "${mergeable[@]}"; do
     PLAN_CONTENT=$(cat "${ITEM_DIR}/${quick_id}-PLAN.md")
     ENTRY_JSON=$(workflow_run quick-batch cleanup-entry \
       --agent-id "agent-${quick_id}" \
       --worktree-path "$WT_PATH" \
       --branch "$WT_BRANCH" \
       --expected-base "$EXPECTED_BASE" \
       --allowed-bases '["'"$EXPECTED_BASE"'"]' \
       --plan-content "$PLAN_CONTENT" --raw)
     # append $ENTRY_JSON to the merge manifest's "entries" array, in order
   done
   ```
   (`$WT_PATH`/`$WT_BRANCH`/`$EXPECTED_BASE` per item come from the recorded
   `$QUICK_BATCH_WORKTREE_MANIFEST` entry Step 6 wrote for that `agent_id`
   THIS process, when present.

   **Durable fallback (#3677):** for an item Step 6 did NOT dispatch this
   process — the crash-window guard correctly skipped it because
   `SUMMARY.md` already existed from a PRIOR, now-dead coordinator process —
   `$QUICK_BATCH_WORKTREE_MANIFEST` has no entry for it at all (it is a
   fresh per-process `mktemp` file). Read `$WT_PATH`/`$WT_BRANCH`/
   `$EXPECTED_BASE` from that item's OWN durable
   `dispatched_worktree`/`dispatched_branch`/`dispatched_base` fields in
   `$BATCH_MANIFEST_JSON` instead — persisted by Step 6's own durable-
   persistence step at the time it actually created the worktree, in
   whichever process that was. If ALL THREE are still `null` (the item was
   never durably recorded — should not happen once Step 6 always persists
   on dispatch, but fail closed rather than guess): route this entry via
   `merge-routing --kind merge_failed --detail "missing durable worktree
   record"` the same as any other blocked entry below, and do NOT attempt
   the cleanup-wave call for it.)

4. **Merge, one at a time, via the SAME bounded primitive every other worktree
   consumer uses** (never hand-roll `git merge`):
   ```bash
   QB_CLEANUP_RESULT=$(workflow_run query worktree.cleanup-wave --manifest "$MERGE_MANIFEST_PATH" --raw) || true
   ```
   `executeWorktreeWaveCleanupPlan` isolates each entry's failure by default
   (a blocked entry does not stop the rest of the manifest) except the one
   carve-out where the repo is left genuinely mid-merge, which halts the
   remaining entries in THIS manifest — resume picks them up on the next
   round/invocation.

5. **Route each entry's result:**
   - `status == "merged_removed"`: success. Mark the item's completion pending
     (Step 9 calls `quick-batch complete` for it — do NOT call it here; a
     `--validate` item still has verification ahead of it). **Clear the
     durable worktree-recovery fields now (#3677)** — the worktree no
     longer exists on disk, so its `dispatched_worktree`/`dispatched_branch`/
     `dispatched_base` must not keep pointing at a removed path:
     ```bash
     workflow_run quick-batch update --batch "$BATCH_ID" --updates '[{"quickId":"'"$quick_id"'","dispatchedWorktree":null,"dispatchedBranch":null,"dispatchedBase":null}]'
     ```
   - Any other status: route via
     ```bash
     workflow_run quick-batch merge-routing --kind merge_failed --detail "$reason" --raw
     ```
     (or `--kind scope_violation` when `$reason` names an undeclared
     deletion — `partitionDeclaredDeletions`'s own guard). The routing result
     always carries `preserveWorktree: true` — do NOT remove the worktree or
     branch for this item; leave it for diagnosis (row 28/34/35). Do NOT call
     `quick-batch complete` for it. Continue with the rest of the batch (row
     33 — unrelated items are unaffected).

Continue to Step 9 (`--validate` routes through the verification step first)
once every wave with a mergeable prefix has been processed this round.

This complete authoring guide retains its source content, examples, and methods.
Only recorded namespace/reference substitutions and explicit local conflict

The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The retained `config.json`, `/workflow:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe supporting source capabilities;
this import does not install or activate them. Source catalog pointers in examples
identify provenance, not executable command arguments. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
