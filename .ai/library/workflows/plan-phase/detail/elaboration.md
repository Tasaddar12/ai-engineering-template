# plan-phase — Detail

Elaboration deferred from the `plan-phase.md` spine under ADR-4139 (Compact Content mode). Read via `.ai/library/references/compact-content-gate.md` when `workflow.compact_content` is `false`. This file supplements the spine — it does not stand alone.

## § 9a — Filesystem Fallback (Planner)

This elaborates the spine's §9a trigger condition (above) — the recovery banner and its three options.

```bash
# #3218: this asks "did the planner write files to disk at all" — a
# planner-produced-nothing check, not outstanding-work counting — so it
# takes the PHYSICAL set (`plan_count_all`, status:superseded INCLUDED): a
# superseded plan is still a file the planner wrote, and this check must not
# read "nothing written" just because every plan happens to be superseded.
```

The spine already computed `DISK_PLANS` (above) before reaching this elaboration.

**If `DISK_PLANS` > 0:** The planner wrote plans to disk but the Agent() return was empty or
truncated (the Windows stdio hang pattern — the subagent finished but the return never
arrived). Display:

```text
◆ Planner wrote {DISK_PLANS} plan(s) to disk but did not emit a PLANNING COMPLETE marker.
  This is a known Windows stdio hang pattern — work is likely recoverable.

  Plans found on disk:
  {ls output of *-PLAN.md}
```

Offer 3 options:
1. **Accept plans** — treat as `## PLANNING COMPLETE` and continue through step 9 `## PLANNING COMPLETE` handling (so `--skip-verify` / `plan_checker_enabled=false` are honored — may skip to step 13 rather than step 10)
2. **Retry planner** — re-spawn the planner with the same prompt (return to step 8)
3. **Stop** — exit; user can re-run `/workflow:plan-phase {N}` to resume

**If `DISK_PLANS` is 0 and no marker:** The planner produced no output. Treat as
`## PLANNING INCONCLUSIVE` and handle accordingly.

## § 9b — Handle Phase Split Recommendation

When the planner returns `## PHASE SPLIT RECOMMENDED`, it means the phase's source items exceed the context budget for full-fidelity implementation. The planner proposes groupings.

**Extract from planner return:**
- Proposed sub-phases (e.g., "17a: processing core (D-01 to D-19)", "17b: billing + config UX (D-20 to D-27)")
- Which source items (REQ-IDs, D-XX decisions, RESEARCH items) go in each sub-phase
- Why the split is necessary (context cost estimate, file count)

**Present to user:**
```
## Phase {X} exceeds context budget for full-fidelity implementation

The planner found {N} source items that exceed the context budget when
planned at full fidelity. Instead of reducing scope, we recommend splitting:

**Option 1: Split into sub-phases**
- Phase {X}a: {name} — {items} ({N} source items, ~{P}% context)
- Phase {X}b: {name} — {items} ({M} source items, ~{Q}% context)

**Option 2: Proceed anyway** (planner will attempt all, quality may degrade past 50% context)

**Option 3: Prioritize** — you choose which items to implement now,
rest become a follow-up phase
```

Use AskUserQuestion with these 3 options.

**If "Split":** Use `/workflow:phase --insert` to create the sub-phases, then replan each.
**If "Proceed":** Return to planner with instruction to attempt all items at full fidelity, accepting more plans/tasks.
**If "Prioritize":** Use AskUserQuestion (multiSelect) to let user pick which items are "now" vs "later". Create CONTEXT.md for each sub-phase with the selected items.

## § 9c — Handle Source Audit Gaps

When the planner returns `## ⚠ Source Audit: Unplanned Items Found`, it means items from REQUIREMENTS.md, RESEARCH.md, ROADMAP goal, or CONTEXT.md decisions have no corresponding plan.

**Extract from planner return:**
- Each unplanned item with its source artifact and section
- The planner's suggested options (A: add plan, B: split phase, C: defer with confirmation)

**Present each gap to user.** For each unplanned item:

```
## ⚠ Unplanned: {item description}

Source: {RESEARCH.md / REQUIREMENTS.md / ROADMAP goal / CONTEXT.md}
Details: {why the planner flagged this}

Options:
1. Add a plan to cover this item (recommended)
2. Split phase — move to a sub-phase with related items
3. Defer — add to backlog (developer confirms this is intentional)
```

Use AskUserQuestion for each gap (or batch if multiple gaps).

**If "Add plan":** Return to planner (step 8) with instruction to add plans covering the missing items, preserving existing plans.
**If "Split":** Use `/workflow:phase --insert` for overflow items, then replan.
**If "Defer":** Record in CONTEXT.md `## Deferred Ideas` with developer's confirmation. Proceed to step 10.

## § 11a — Filesystem Fallback (Checker)

Fires when the checker's Agent() call comes back without either completion marker (`## VERIFICATION PASSED` / `## ISSUES FOUND`). The spine already computed `DISK_PLANS` before reaching this elaboration.

**If `DISK_PLANS` > 0:** Plans exist on disk; the checker return was empty or truncated (the
Windows stdio hang pattern — the subagent finished but the return never arrived). Display:

```text
◆ Checker return was empty or truncated. {DISK_PLANS} plan(s) exist on disk.
  This is a known Windows stdio hang pattern — checker may have completed without returning.
```

Offer 3 options:
1. **Accept verification** — treat as `## VERIFICATION PASSED` and continue to step 13
2. **Retry checker** — re-spawn the checker with the same prompt (return to step 10)
3. **Stop** — exit; user can re-run `/workflow:plan-phase {N}` to resume

**If `DISK_PLANS` is 0:** No plans on disk — something is seriously wrong. Display error and stop.

## § 11 thinking-partner — Thinking Partner For Architectural Tradeoffs

**Thinking partner for architectural tradeoffs (conditional):**
If `features.thinking_partner` is enabled, scan the checker's issues for architectural tradeoff keywords
("architecture", "approach", "strategy", "pattern", "vs", "alternative"). If found:

```
The plan-checker flagged an architectural decision point:
{issue description}

Brief analysis:
- Option A: {approach_from_plan} — {pros/cons}
- Option B: {alternative_approach} — {pros/cons}
- Recommendation: {choice} aligned with {phase_goal}

Apply this to the revision? [Yes] / [No, I'll decide]
```

If yes: include the recommendation in the revision prompt. If no: proceed to revision loop as normal.
If thinking_partner disabled: skip this block entirely.

## § 12.5 — Plan Bounce (Optional External Refinement)

**Skip if:** `--skip-bounce` flag, `--gaps` flag, or bounce is not activated.

**Activation:** Bounce runs when `--bounce` flag is present OR `workflow.plan_bounce` config is `true`. The `--skip-bounce` flag always wins (disables bounce even if config enables it). The `--gaps` flag also disables bounce (gap-closure mode should not modify plans externally).

**Prerequisites:** `workflow.plan_bounce_script` must be set to a valid script path. If bounce is activated but no script is configured, display warning and skip:
```
⚠ Plan bounce activated but no script configured.
Set workflow.plan_bounce_script to the path of your refinement script.
Skipping bounce step.
```

**Read pass count:**
```bash
_Workflow_SHIM_NAME="workflow-tools.cjs"; _Workflow_RUNTIME_ROOT="${RUNTIME_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}"; Workflow_TOOLS="${_Workflow_RUNTIME_ROOT}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}"; _workflow_at() { for _p; do if [ -f "$_p" ]; then Workflow_TOOLS="$_p"; return 0; fi; done; return 1; }; if _workflow_at "${_Workflow_RUNTIME_ROOT}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${_Workflow_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.claude/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${_Workflow_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.codex/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}"; then workflow_run() { node "$Workflow_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif unset -f workflow_run; _G="$(command -v workflow_run)"; then Workflow_TOOLS="$_G"; workflow_run() { "$Workflow_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif _workflow_at "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cursor}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${COPILOT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.copilot}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${WINDSURF_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codeium/windsurf}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${AUGMENT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.augment}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${TRAE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.trae}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${QWEN_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.qwen}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEBUDDY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codebuddy}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${CLINE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cline}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${GROK_AGENTS_HOME:-$HOME/.agents}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${ANTIGRAVITY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini/antigravity}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/opencode}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}" "${KILO_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/kilo}/workflow-core/bin/${_Workflow_SHIM_NAME}"; then workflow_run() { node "$Workflow_TOOLS" "$@"; }; else echo "ERROR: workflow-tools.cjs not found at $Workflow_TOOLS and workflow_run is not on PATH.

BOUNCE_PASSES=$(workflow_run query config-get workflow.plan_bounce_passes --raw 2>/dev/null || echo "2")
BOUNCE_SCRIPT=$(workflow_run query config-get workflow.plan_bounce_script --raw 2>/dev/null || true)
```

Display banner:
```
### Workflow ► BOUNCING PLANS (External Refinement)

Script: ${BOUNCE_SCRIPT}
Max passes: ${BOUNCE_PASSES}
```

**For each PLAN.md file in the phase directory:**

1. **Backup:** Copy `*-PLAN.md` to `*-PLAN.pre-bounce.md`
```bash
cp "${PLAN_FILE}" "${PLAN_FILE%.md}.pre-bounce.md"
```

2. **Invoke bounce script:**
```bash
"${BOUNCE_SCRIPT}" "${PLAN_FILE}" "${BOUNCE_PASSES}"
```

3. **Validate bounced plan — YAML frontmatter integrity:**
After the script returns, check that the bounced file still has valid YAML frontmatter (opening and closing `---` delimiters with parseable content between them). If the bounced plan breaks YAML frontmatter validation, restore the original from the pre-bounce.md backup and continue to the next plan:
```
⚠ Bounced plan ${PLAN_FILE} has broken YAML frontmatter — restoring original from pre-bounce backup.
```

4. **Handle script failure:** If the bounce script exits non-zero, restore the original plan from the pre-bounce.md backup and continue to the next plan:
```
⚠ Bounce script failed for ${PLAN_FILE} (exit code ${EXIT_CODE}) — restoring original from pre-bounce backup.
```

**After all plans are bounced:**

5. **Re-run plan checker on bounced plans:** Spawn plan-checker (same as step 10) on all modified plans. If a bounced plan fails the checker, restore original from its pre-bounce.md backup:
```
⚠ Bounced plan ${PLAN_FILE} failed checker validation — restoring original from pre-bounce backup.
```

6. **Commit surviving bounced plans:** If at least one plan survived both the frontmatter validation and the checker re-run, commit the changes:
```bash
workflow_run query commit "refactor(${padded_phase}): bounce plans through external refinement" --files "${PHASE_DIR}/*-PLAN.md"
```

Display summary:
```
Plan bounce complete: {survived}/{total} plans refined
```

**Clean up:** Remove all `*-PLAN.pre-bounce.md` backup files after the bounce step completes (whether plans survived or were restored).

names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe supporting source capabilities;
this import does not install or activate them. Source catalog pointers in examples
identify provenance, not executable command arguments. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
