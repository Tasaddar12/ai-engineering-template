## 3.6. Handle ADR Ingest Express Path

**Skip if:** No `--ingest` flag in arguments.

**If `--ingest <path-or-glob>` provided:**

1. Display banner: `Workflow ► ADR Ingest Express Path` with `{INGEST_PATH}` and `{INGEST_FORMAT}`.
2. Parse each resolved ADR through `workflow-core/bin/lib/adr-parser.cjs` (`--input`, `--format`) and collect normalized records.
3. Status gate: reject `superseded`/`rejected`/`deprecated`; warn on `proposed`; missing status defaults to `accepted`.
4. Empty-decisions fallback: if all parsed ADRs have zero `decisions[]`, emit `ADR ingest produced no locked decisions; fall back to discuss-phase for this phase.` and exit with `/workflow:discuss-phase {N}` guidance.
5. Generate CONTEXT.md using `<domain>`, `<decisions>`, `<canonical_refs>`, `<specifics>`, `<deferred>`, `<scope_fence>`, map `consequences_positive[]` to Success Criteria and `consequences_negative[]` to Risk Summary, and include `**Source:** ADR Ingest Express Path ({INGEST_PATH})`.
6. Commit with `workflow_run query commit "docs(${padded_phase}): generate context from ADR ingest" --files "${phase_dir}/${padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md"` and set `context_content`; continue to step 5.

**Effect:** This bypasses step 4 (Load CONTEXT.md) since CONTEXT.md was synthesized from ADR input.

## Local adoption — read before using this source

This complete authoring guide retains its source content, examples, and methods.
Only recorded namespace/reference substitutions and explicit local conflict
corrections have been made. Source attribution and exact original hashes are
isolated in `.ai/library/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and `PROVENANCE.json`.

Read `.ai/library/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/template-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The retained `config.json`, `/workflow:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe supporting source capabilities;
this import does not install or activate them. Source catalog pointers in examples
identify provenance, not executable command arguments. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
