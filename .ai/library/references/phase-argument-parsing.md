# Phase Argument Parsing

Parse and normalize phase arguments for commands that operate on phases.

## Extraction

From `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Extract phase number (first numeric argument)
- Extract flags (prefixed with `--`)
- Remaining text is description (for insert/add commands)

## Using workflow-tools

The `find-phase` command handles normalization and validation in one step:

```bash
PHASE_INFO=$(workflow_run query find-phase "${PHASE}")
```

Returns JSON with:
- `found`: true/false
- `directory`: Full path to phase directory
- `phase_number`: Normalized number (e.g., "06", "06.1")
- `phase_name`: Name portion (e.g., "foundation")
- `plans`: Array of PLAN.md files
- `summaries`: Array of SUMMARY.md files

## Manual Normalization (Legacy)

Zero-pad integer phases to 2 digits. Preserve decimal suffixes.

```bash
# Normalize phase number
if [[ "$PHASE" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  # Integer: 8 → 08
  PHASE=$(printf "%02d" "$PHASE")
elif [[ "$PHASE" =~ ^([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)$ ]]; then
  # Decimal: 2.1 → 02.1
  PHASE=$(printf "%02d.%s" "${BASH_REMATCH[1]}" "${BASH_REMATCH[2]}")
fi
```

## Validation

Use `roadmap get-phase` to validate phase exists:

```bash
PHASE_CHECK=$(workflow_run query roadmap.get-phase "${PHASE}" --pick found)
if [ "$PHASE_CHECK" = "false" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Phase ${PHASE} not found in roadmap"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Directory Lookup

Use `find-phase` for directory lookup:

```bash
PHASE_DIR=$(workflow_run query find-phase "${PHASE}" --raw)
```

## Local adoption — read before using this source

This complete authoring guide retains its source content, examples, and methods.
Only recorded namespace/reference substitutions and explicit local conflict
corrections have been made. Source attribution and exact original hashes are
isolated in `.ai/library/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and `PROVENANCE.json`.

Read `.ai/library/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/template-adaptation.md` for local conflict decisions,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. The retained `config.json`, `/workflow:*` commands, tool
names, hooks, and Node CLI examples describe supporting source capabilities;
this import does not install or activate them. Source catalog pointers in examples
identify provenance, not executable command arguments. Retained specialty workflows are full source
guidance for explicit future integration, not promises of installed features.
Local rules, assigned worktrees, recorded authorization, runtime ownership and
verification safeguards govern execution. The local runtime never merges.
