# Full implementation run

The user requested implementation of the full current plan on 2026-09-07.
The starting code commit is `501b512`. This run preserves the revised product
layout and the existing bootstrap rather than restoring the superseded package
layout. Repository implementation uses the recorded Sol/xhigh override and
independent Astra/xhigh reviews.

## Baseline

On Windows with Python 3.12 and the declared `jsonschema` dependency:

- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 24 tests passed.
- `python src/validate_foundation.py`: passed; 27 schemas, 121 artifacts,
  one plan, 39 tasks, 280 unordered pairs, three historical manifests, and
  173 local links checked.

The first attempt using the bundled Python without a virtual environment could
not import `jsonschema`. Installing the declared development dependency into
an ignored local environment resolved that environment issue; no source fix
was required.

## Execution boundary

Graph r3 is still proposed at the start of this run. A fresh independent
isolation review is in progress. No engine task has been started or accepted.
Task implementations will use separate branches and worktrees, observed test
results, and independent implementation and consistency review before accepted
dependency handoffs. Integration, completion, and cleanup will be recorded as
they occur; proposed or unexecuted work is not evidence of completion.

The product milestone is the local deterministic engine described by the
current specification. Production model/hosting adapters, external publication,
and public release remain separate scope.
