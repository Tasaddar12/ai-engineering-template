# Phase {N} — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | {pytest 7.x / jest 29.x / vitest / go test / other} |
| **Config file** | {path or "none — Wave 0 installs"} |
| **Quick run command** | `{quick command}` |
| **Full suite command** | `{full command}` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~{N} seconds |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `{quick run command}`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `{full suite command}`
- **Before phase verification:** Full suite must be green
- **Max feedback latency:** {N} seconds

---

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| {N}-01-01 | 01 | 1 | REQ-{XX} | T-{N}-01 / — | {expected secure behavior or "N/A"} | unit | `{command}` | ✅ / ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] `{tests/test_file.py}` — stubs for REQ-{XX}
- [ ] `{tests/conftest.py}` — shared fixtures
- [ ] `{framework install}` — if no framework detected

*If none: "Existing infrastructure covers all phase requirements."*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| {behavior} | REQ-{XX} | {reason} | {steps} |

*If none: "All phase behaviors have automated verification."*

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: at least 2 automated verifications in every consecutive 3-task window within a wave
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < {N}s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** {pending / approved YYYY-MM-DD}

## Local adoption — read before using this source

Read this complete authoring guide, including its examples and methods.
Source attribution is available in `.ai/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.

Read `.ai/agents/README.md` for the local producer/consumer mapping and execution
boundary, `.ai/references/template-adaptation.md` for local runtime behavior,
and `.ai/runtime/TEMPLATE-CONTRACT.md` for additive local artifact
fields. Project records live in `.planning/`; reusable guidance lives in `.ai/`.
The active lifecycle uses `.ai/commands/` and `.ai/runtime/phase.py` with
`.planning/config.yaml`. Only the documented local runtime commands are installed. Tool names and product
examples do not establish that a tool is available; inspect the actual project
configuration and host capabilities before using them. Bundled supporting methods provide local guidance for explicit assignments;
they do not install additional runtime features.
Local rules, recorded authorization, plan-declared ownership and verification
safeguards govern execution. Publication never merges.
