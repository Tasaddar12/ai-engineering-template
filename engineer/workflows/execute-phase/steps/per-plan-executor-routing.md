# Per-plan executor routing (#1689)

Run for each plan, immediately before its `Agent()` dispatch in step 3. Sets
`EXECUTOR_TYPE` so a plan can opt into a specialist executor instead of the
default `executor`. `plan_json` (the current plan's object from
`phase-plan-index`, same scope step 2.5 uses) is in scope.

## Contract

- Default: `EXECUTOR_TYPE="executor"` — byte-identical to pre-#1689 dispatch.
- A plan opts into a specialist by declaring `agent_hint: <name>` in its PLAN.md
  frontmatter. The field reaches the orchestrator as `plan_json.agent_hint`
  (parsed by `phase-plan-index`; `null` when unset).
- When routing is enabled AND the hint is non-empty AND the named agent resolves
  on the active runtime, `EXECUTOR_TYPE` becomes the hint. Otherwise it stays
  `executor`.
- The resolved `EXECUTOR_TYPE` is used as `subagent_type` in BOTH worktree and
  sequential dispatch (sequential reuses the worktree-mode `Agent()` template).

## Resolution

```bash
_engineer_identity_ok() {
  [ -f "$1" ] || return 1
  [ "$(sh "$1" query runtime-identity --pick packageName --raw 2>/dev/null)" = "engineer-runtime" ]
}
_engineer_select() {
  for _engineer_candidate do
    if _engineer_identity_ok "$_engineer_candidate"; then
      ENGINEER_RUN="$_engineer_candidate"
      return 0
    fi
  done
  return 1
}
if [ -n "${ENGINEER_RUN:-}" ]; then
  _engineer_identity_ok "$ENGINEER_RUN" || {
    printf '%s\n' "ERROR: ENGINEER_RUN does not identify engineer-runtime: $ENGINEER_RUN" >&2
    exit 1
  }
else
  _engineer_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
  _engineer_runtime_root=${RUNTIME_DIR:-$_engineer_root}
  _engineer_path_candidate=$(command -v engineer_run 2>/dev/null || true)
  _engineer_select \
    "$_engineer_root/engineer/bin/engineer_run" \
    "$_engineer_runtime_root/engineer/bin/engineer_run" \
    "$_engineer_root/.claude/engineer/bin/engineer_run" \
    "$_engineer_root/.codex/engineer/bin/engineer_run" \
    "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/engineer/bin/engineer_run" \
    "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/engineer/bin/engineer_run" \
    "$_engineer_path_candidate" || {
    printf '%s\n' 'ERROR: No engineer-runtime launcher was found. Install the Claude or Codex workflow runtime or set ENGINEER_RUN.' >&2
    exit 1
  }
fi
export ENGINEER_RUN
engineer_run() {
  sh "$ENGINEER_RUN" "$@"
}
if [ -n "${CLAUDE_ENV_FILE:-}" ]; then
  _engineer_path_escaped=$(printf '%s' "${ENGINEER_RUN%/*}" | sed 's/[\\`"$]/\\&/g')
  printf 'export PATH="%s:$PATH"\n' "$_engineer_path_escaped" >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" 2>/dev/null || true
fi
# Default-on; opt out with: engineer_run query config-set workflow.agent_hint_routing false
AGENT_HINT_ROUTING=$(engineer_run query config-get workflow.agent_hint_routing --raw 2>/dev/null || echo "true")

EXECUTOR_TYPE="executor"
if [ "${AGENT_HINT_ROUTING:-true}" != "false" ]; then
  PLAN_HINT=$(jq -r '.agent_hint // empty' <<<"$plan_json" 2>/dev/null | tr -d '"')
  if [ -n "$PLAN_HINT" ]; then
    EXECUTOR_TYPE=$(engineer_run query resolve-agent --name "$PLAN_HINT" --raw 2>/dev/null || echo "executor")
  fi
fi

```

`engineer_run query resolve-agent` consults the **active runtime's agent directory**
(both project-local and user-global, across runtime filename variants — `.md`,
`.toml`) and fails
closed to `executor` when the named agent does not resolve or on any error,
so a missing or misspelled hint never blocks dispatch.

## Checkpoint handling

Resolve decisions within delegated discretion from approved context and evidence, record consequential outcomes with state.add-decision, and continue only authorized work. A real human decision blocks dependent work and is named in the closing report. Never infer approval from an unattended mode. Confirm worker stop and continue a handoff only in a fresh isolated checkout.

Resolve the routed EXECUTOR_TYPE model and effort inline with engineer_run query resolve-model and resolve-effort. Omit inherit fields. Both isolation modes use native Agent dispatch and honor the same routed role.
