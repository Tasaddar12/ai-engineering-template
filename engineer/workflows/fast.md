<purpose>
Execute a trivial task inline without subagent overhead. No PLAN.md, no Task spawning,
no research, no plan checking. Just: understand → do → commit → log.

For tasks like: fix a typo, update a config value, add a missing import, rename a
variable, commit uncommitted work, add a .gitignore entry, bump a version number.

Use /quick for anything that needs multi-step planning or research.
</purpose>

<process>

<step name="parse_task">
Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the task description.

If empty, ask:
```
What's the quick fix? (one sentence)
```

Store as `$TASK`.
</step>

<step name="scope_check">
**Before doing anything, verify this is actually trivial.**

A task is trivial if it can be completed in:
- ≤ 3 file edits
- ≤ 1 minute of work
- No new dependencies or architecture changes
- No research needed

If the task seems non-trivial (multi-file refactor, new feature, needs research),
say:

```
This looks like it needs planning. Use /quick instead:
  /quick "{task description}"
```

And stop.
</step>

<step name="execute_inline">
Do the work directly:

1. Read the relevant file(s)
2. Make the change(s)
3. Verify the change works (run existing tests if applicable, or do a quick sanity check)

**No PLAN.md.** Just do it.
</step>

<step name="commit">
Commit the change atomically:

```bash
_engineer_identity_ok() {
  [ -f "$1" ] || return 1
  [ "$(sh "$1" query runtime-identity --pick packageName --raw 2>/dev/null)" = "engineer-runtime" ]

# fast writes no planning artifacts (its own guardrails forbid PLAN.md/SUMMARY.md); .planning/

# byte-identical to an unconditional `git add -A`.

git commit -m "fix: {concise description of what changed}"
```

Use conventional commit format: `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:` as appropriate.
</step>

<step name="log_to_state">
If `.planning/STATE.md` exists and has a "Quick Tasks Completed" table, append a row
that matches the existing table's schema via the schema-backed `engineer_run
quick-tasks-append` command. Its Python implementation is in
`engineer/bin/lib/markdown_table.py`.
If no table exists, skip silently. If the table's schema is
unrecognized, the helper fails loud (non-zero exit) instead of silently guessing
a column count.

```bash
# Detect whether STATE.md has a Quick Tasks Completed table
if grep -q "Quick Tasks Completed" .planning/STATE.md 2>/dev/null; then
  # Bring a legacy pre-registry table onto the canonical schema BEFORE
  # appending — silent no-op when already canonical, so this runs harmlessly
  # on every fast task and migrates exactly once, on the first.
  engineer_run quick-tasks-migrate || true
  engineer_run quick-tasks-append --task "$TASK" || echo "⚠ fast.md log_to_state: could not append Quick Tasks row (see message above); continuing."
fi
```
</step>

<step name="done">
Report completion:

```
✅ Done: {what was changed}
   Commit: {short hash}
   Files: {list of changed files}
```

No next-step suggestions. No workflow routing. Just done.
</step>

<guardrails>
- NEVER spawn a Task/subagent — this runs inline
- NEVER create PLAN.md or SUMMARY.md files
- NEVER run research or plan-checking
- If the task takes more than 3 file edits, STOP and redirect to /quick
- If you're unsure how to implement it, STOP and redirect to /quick
</guardrails>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Task completed in current context (no subagents)
- [ ] Atomic git commit with conventional message
- [ ] STATE.md updated if it exists
- [ ] Total operation under 2 minutes wall time
