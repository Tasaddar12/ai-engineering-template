<step name="init_context">
Load todo context:

```bash
IFS= read -rd '' ENGINEER_ARGS <<'ENGINEER_ARGS_END' || true
$ARGUMENTS
ENGINEER_ARGS_END
ENGINEER_ARGS=${ENGINEER_ARGS%$'\n'}
_engineer_identity_ok() {

```

Extract from init JSON: `todo_count`, `todos`, `pending_dir`, `response_language`.

**If `response_language` is set:** All user-facing output of this workflow — narration between tool calls, status updates, progress notes, findings, questions, prompts, and explanations — MUST be presented in `{response_language}`. Technical terms, code, file paths, and subagent prompts stay in English — only user-facing output is translated.

If `todo_count` is 0:
```
No pending todos.

Todos are captured during work sessions with /add-todo.

---

Would you like to:

1. Continue with current phase (/progress)
2. Add a todo now (/add-todo)
```

Exit.
</step>

<step name="parse_filter">
Check for area filter in arguments:
- `/capture --list` → show all
- `/capture --list api` → filter to area:api only
</step>

<step name="list_todos">
Use the `todos` array from init context (already filtered by area if specified).

Parse and display as numbered list:

```
Pending Todos:

1. Add auth token refresh (api, 2d ago)
2. Fix modal z-index issue (ui, 1d ago)
3. Refactor database connection pool (database, 5h ago)

---

Reply with a number to view details, or:
- `/capture --list [area]` to filter by area
- `q` to exit
```

Format age as relative time from created timestamp.
</step>

<step name="handle_selection">
Wait for user to reply with a number.

If valid: load selected todo, proceed.
If invalid: "Invalid selection. Reply with a number (1-[N]) or `q` to exit."
</step>

<step name="load_context">
Read the todo file completely. Display:

```
## [title]

**Area:** [area]
**Created:** [date] ([relative time] ago)
**Files:** [list or "None"]

### Problem
[problem section content]

### Solution
[solution section content]
```

If `files` field has entries, read and briefly summarize each.
</step>

<step name="check_roadmap">
Check for roadmap (can use init progress or directly check file existence):

If `.planning/ROADMAP.md` exists:
1. Check if todo's area matches an upcoming phase
2. Check if todo's files overlap with a phase's scope
3. Note any match for action options
</step>

<step name="offer_actions">
**If todo maps to a roadmap phase:**


**Text mode (`workflow.text_mode: true` in config or `--text` flag):** Set `TEXT_MODE=true` if `--text` is present in `$ARGUMENTS` OR `text_mode` from init JSON is `true`. When TEXT_MODE is active, replace every `AskUserQuestion` call with a plain-text numbered list and ask the user to type their choice number. This is required for non-Claude runtimes (OpenAI Codex) where `AskUserQuestion` is not available.
Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Action"
- question: "This todo relates to Phase [N]: [name]. What would you like to do?"
- options:
  - "Work on it now" — move to done, start working
  - "Add to phase plan" — include when planning Phase [N]
  - "Brainstorm approach" — think through before deciding
  - "Put it back" — return to list

**If no roadmap match:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Action"
- question: "What would you like to do with this todo?"
- options:
  - "Work on it now" — move to done, start working
  - "Create a phase" — /phase with this scope
  - "Brainstorm approach" — think through before deciding
  - "Put it back" — return to list
</step>

<step name="execute_action">
**Work on it now:**
```bash
mv ".planning/todos/pending/[filename]" ".planning/todos/completed/"
```
Update STATE.md todo count. Present problem/solution context. Begin work or ask how to proceed.

**Add to phase plan:**
Note todo reference in phase planning notes. Keep in pending. Return to list or exit.

**Create a phase:**
Display: `/phase "[description from todo]"`
Keep in pending. User runs command in fresh context.

**Brainstorm approach:**
Keep in pending. Start discussion about problem and approaches.

**Put it back:**
Return to list_todos step.
</step>

<step name="update_state">
If `.planning/STATE.md` exists:

1. Re-run `engineer_run query init.todos ${ENGINEER_WS:+--ws=${ENGINEER_WS##* }}` (same workstream flag as the first call) to get a fresh, post-write JSON snapshot (the count and rendering must reflect the change just made).
2. **Fail-safe check:** if the JSON failed to parse, or `pending_read_ok` is not `true`, or `pending_todos_markdown` is not a string, do NOT touch the "### Pending Todos" section — leave it exactly as-is and continue to the next step. A partial or malformed `init.todos` result must never overwrite a good existing section.
3. Otherwise, replace the entire body of "### Pending Todos" (under "## Accumulated Context") with the literal value of `pending_todos_markdown` — verbatim, one bullet per pending todo already rendered and length-capped by `init.todos`. Do not reformat, re-wrap, re-order, or hand-edit the bullets; do not append to the old body — replace it wholesale (this is what makes an old run-on-sentence section get superseded cleanly with no migration step).
</step>

<step name="git_commit">
If todo was moved to completed/, commit the change:

```bash
git rm --cached .planning/todos/pending/[filename] 2>/dev/null || true
engineer_run query commit "docs: start work on todo - [title]" --files .planning/todos/completed/[filename] .planning/STATE.md
```

Tool respects `commit_docs` config and gitignore automatically.

Confirm: "Committed: docs: start work on todo - [title]"
</step>
